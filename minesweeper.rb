# REV: I like what your code does, in general
# it's clean, but could use some refactoring
# I think a few methods got a little lengthy
# other than that I don't think I had much
# that was valuable to say...
# I made one long comment about reveal
# nothing was wrong, just shared an alternative
# the code was awesome!
# great job! :)
