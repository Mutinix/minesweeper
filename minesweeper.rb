# REV: I like what your code does, in general
# it's clean, but could use some refactoring
# I think a few methods got a little lengthy
# other than that I don't think I had much
# that was valuable to say...
# I made one long comment about reveal
# nothing was wrong, just shared an alternative
# the code was awesome!
# great job! :)

# types of squares
# * - unexplored   => ‚ñ†
# m - unrevealed mine => üí£
# M - revealed mine => üí£
# F - flagged correctly => ‚öë
# f - flagged incorrectly => ‚öë
# _ - interior => ‚ñ°
# 1 - fringe square => 1 = blue; 2 = green; 3 = red
#                   => 4 = d blue; 5 = brown; 6 = pale blue
#                   => 7 = black; 8 = grey
